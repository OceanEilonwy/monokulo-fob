//! Copied from monokulo-lws, `crates/lws-api/src/lib.rs` at 71e1ffd (branch `sending`)
//! (github.com/OceanEilonwy/monokulo-lws, private), as decision 44 copied
//! Monokulo's ZMTP: Fob depends on no private repository CI can't fetch.
//! Kept in sync by hand; only this header differs. When it changes there,
//! copy it again below this header and update the rev here.
//!
//! Wire types of the Monero light wallet server REST API.
//!
//! The shapes follow the community specification
//! (monero-project/meta, `api/lightwallet_rest.md`) and the extensions
//! monero-lws added on top of it without changing it: subaddress
//! provisioning (`/get_subaddrs`, `/upsert_subaddrs`, `/provision_subaddrs`),
//! `/get_version`, `received_output` lists on transactions, and the
//! `lookahead` fields. A client that knows only the community spec can
//! ignore every extension field.
//!
//! Every request is an HTTP `POST` of a JSON object to `/<method>`; every
//! response is a JSON object. Amounts travel as decimal strings
//! ([`Amount`]), keys and hashes as lowercase hex ([`Hex32`], [`Hex8`]),
//! timestamps as ISO 8601 text ([`Timestamp`]).
//!
//! `Debug` on the types that carry a private view key ([`Login`] and the
//! admin requests) prints neither the key nor the address, and a type's
//! deserialization errors never quote the value that failed, so neither
//! ends up in a log by accident.
